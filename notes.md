# CSS Positioning Notes

## Position

- static: observe the natural flow of the html document. acknowledges other elements.
- absolute: positions itself based off of the first parent it finds with a position tag
- relative: move relative to your normal positioning
- fixed: position based off of the whole window. does not move with scroll


## Box Sizing

- border-box: when using padding it will not increase the size of the container


## Flex

### justify-content/align-items
- space-between: puts space between all the elements and fills availilbe space.
- space-around: puts space between all the elements and the space on the outside
- center: yup it centers

### flex-direction
column: flows top to bottom
row: flows left to right
reverse-column: flips the order
